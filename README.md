How to use the AGPLv3 license correctly?
The AGPLv3 license comes with a couple of restrictions you should be well aware of.
Disclose and distribute all source code, including your own
You may not deploy it on a network without disclosing the full source code of your own applications under the AGPL license. You must distribute all source code, including your own product and web-based applications.
Only allowed in AGPL environments
Itâ€™s a legal violation to use iText Core/Community and our open source add-ons in a non-AGPL environment.
Modifications made to the source code
You must disclose any modifications made to iText.
Producer line and copyright
When using iText Core/Community under AGPL, you must prominently mention iText and include the iText copyright and AGPL license in output file metadata, and also retain the producer line in every PDF that is created or manipulated using iText.
